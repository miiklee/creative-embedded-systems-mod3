# creative-embedded-systems-mod3

This repo contains code to run a servo motor off of an ESP32 with TTGO display.

It was created for an assignment to make a kinetic sculpture, and was used in conjunction
with a DC motor attached directly to the power and ground pins on an ESP32.

This repository also contains photos of the kinetic sculpture in installation with other
projects for the same class
